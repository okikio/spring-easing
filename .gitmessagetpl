# Full spec: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0
#
# TYPE
# ======================================================================
# Can be one of: feat, fix, chore, build, ci, docs, tests, etc...
#
#  - a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase,
#    this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning.
#
#  - a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase,
#    this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning.
#
#  - types other than fix and feat are allowed, additional types are
#    not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have
#    no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning
#
# SCOPE
# ======================================================================
# A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase
# surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):
#
# FOOTERS
# ======================================================================
# Footers must also be separated by a blank line
# from the body & be on consecutive lines.
#
# A commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the
# type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR
# in Semantic Versioning).
#
# A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
#
# Footers other than BREAKING CHANGE may be provided and follow a
# convention similar to the git trailer format.
# see: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers
